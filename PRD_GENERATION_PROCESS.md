# PRD Generation Process Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) generation process implemented in this system.

## Overview

The PRD Generator is an AI-powered conversational system that acts as an expert Product Manager, guiding stakeholders through the creation of comprehensive Product Requirements Documents for software products. The system uses a structured workflow with multiple phases to gather all necessary information.

## System Architecture

### 5. User Stories
- **Purpose**: Create detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- **Key Questions**:
  - How would a user accomplish [specific task]?
  - What are the edge cases?
  - What would success look like for each feature?
- **Outputs**: Well-formed user stories with acceptance criteria and priorities

### 6. Technical Requirements
- **Purpose**: Gather technical constraints and requirements
- **Key Questions**:
  - What are your performance requirements?
  - Any security or compliance needs?
  - What technologies do you prefer?
  - What integrations are needed?
- **Outputs**: Technical requirements, technology preferences, integration needs

### 7. Success Metrics
- **Purpose**: Define measurable KPIs and success criteria
- **Key Questions**:
  - How will you measure success?
  - What metrics matter most to your business?
  - What are your target values?
- **Outputs**: Specific KPIs, target values, measurement methods

### 8. Constraints & Assumptions
- **Purpose**: Document limitations and assumptions
- **Key Questions**:
  - What's your budget range?
  - What's your timeline?
  - What assumptions are we making?
- **Outputs**: Budget/timeline constraints, key assumptions

### 9. PRD Review
- **Purpose**: Present comprehensive summary for stakeholder review
- **Process**: 
  - Generate structured summary of all gathered information
  - Present each section for review
  - Gather feedback on accuracy and completeness
- **Outputs**: Validated requirements, change requests

### 10. PRD Refinement
- **Purpose**: Make requested changes and improvements
- **Process**:
  - Address specific feedback
  - Make modifications to requirements
  - Re-present updated sections
- **Outputs**: Refined requirements based on feedback

### 11. PRD Finalization
- **Purpose**: Deliver final, polished PRD document
- **Process**:
  - Generate final PRD in markdown format
  - Include all sections with proper formatting
  - Provide implementation guidance
- **Outputs**: Complete PRD document ready for development team

## PRD Document Structure

The final PRD includes the following sections:

1. **Product Overview**: High-level description and context
2. **Product Vision**: Long-term vision and business goals
3. **Target Audience**: Detailed user personas
4. **Core Features**: Essential functionality
5. **User Stories**: Detailed user scenarios with acceptance criteria
6. **Technical Requirements**: Performance, security, and technical constraints
7. **Success Metrics**: KPIs and measurement methods
8. **Constraints & Assumptions**: Budget, timeline, and key assumptions
9. **Integration Requirements**: External system integrations
10. **Technology Preferences**: Preferred technologies and platforms

## Usage Instructions

### Getting Started

1. **Telegram**: Start a conversation with the bot using `/start`
2. **WhatsApp**: Send any message to begin
3. **API**: Send a POST request to `/chat` endpoint

### Commands

- **Telegram**:
  - `/start` - Begin new PRD generation
  - `/status` - Check current progress
  - `/reset` - Start over with new product
  - `/help` - Get help and instructions

- **WhatsApp**:
  - "help" or "start" - Get started
  - "status" or "progress" - Check progress
  - "reset" or "restart" - Start over

### Best Practices

1. **Be Detailed**: Provide comprehensive answers to get better PRDs
2. **Think Through Use Cases**: Consider different user scenarios
3. **Be Realistic**: Set achievable goals and constraints
4. **Iterate**: Use the refinement phase to improve the PRD
5. **Save Progress**: Sessions are automatically saved and can be resumed

## API Endpoints

### Chat Endpoint
```
POST /chat
{
  "message": "Your message here",
  "session_id": "optional_session_id"
}
```

### Session Management
```
GET /session/{session_id}     # Get session info
DELETE /session/{session_id}  # Reset session
```

### Health Check
```
GET /health                   # System health status
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./chat_history.db

# OpenRouter Configuration (Required)
OPENROUTER_TOKEN=your_openrouter_api_key_here
OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-flash

# Telegram Bot Configuration
ENABLE_TELEGRAM=true
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here

# WhatsApp Business API Configuration
ENABLE_WHATSAPP=false
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_whatsapp_access_token_here
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_number_id_here
WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN=your_webhook_verify_token_here
WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret_here
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
# Local testing
python3 test_prd_generation.py

# Docker testing
./run-docker.sh test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Response from Bot**: Check OpenRouter token configuration
2. **Session Not Found**: Verify database connection
3. **Webhook Errors**: Check WhatsApp configuration
4. **Memory Issues**: Ensure database storage is working

### Logs

Check application logs for detailed error information:
```bash
# Docker logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Local logs
Check console output for error messages
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Export Formats**: PDF, Word document export
- **Template Library**: Pre-built PRD templates for common product types
- **Collaboration**: Multi-stakeholder input and review
- **Integration**: Connect with project management tools
- **Analytics**: Usage analytics and PRD quality metrics
